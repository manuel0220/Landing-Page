# Landing-Page

I built this landing page using semantic html and also I added flexbox on the css side, instead of built the hole html first and then the hole css, I followed the advice to build every block first, so I picked one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on, starting at the top.

For the future I'll made this project on a responsive design.

I feel really good about this project because I built it from scratch, I've used the resourses of The Odin Project.
